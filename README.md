# TODO App

A list of steps I used to build this app:

1.  Design a database to store a list of tasks, e.g. task details, priority, completed yes/no
1.  Build the migrations and seed data
1.  Build an API to list, add, update and delete
1.  Test your API with Postman/Insomnia
1.  Build React Components from static html
1.  Design Redux Global State (think of it like a JS object)
1.  Build Redux Reducers (the properties or keys of your state design are reducers, the values are hard-code static data as initialState)
1.  Build API Client in the front end
1.  Build Thunk Actions to get task from the API
1.  Build Redux Actions to save task data from the API (remove hard-code initialState)
